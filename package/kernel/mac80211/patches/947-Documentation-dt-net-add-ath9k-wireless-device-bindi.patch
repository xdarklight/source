+* Qualcomm Atheros ath9k wireless devices
+
+This node provides properties for configuring the ath9k wireless device. The
+node is expected to be specified as a child node of the PCI controller to
+which the wireless chip is connected.
+
+Required properties:
+- compatible: Should be "qca,ath9k"
+
+Optional properties:
+- reg: Address and length of the register set for the device.
+- qca,gpio-mask: The GPIO mask
+- qca,gpio-val: The GPIO value
+- qca,led-pin: The GPIO number to which the LED is connected
+- qca,led-active-high: The LED is active when the GPIO is HIGH
+- qca,clk-25mhz: Defines that at 25MHz clock is used
+- qca,no-eeprom: Indicates that there is on physical EEPROM connected
+			to the ath9k wireless chip (in this case the
+			calibration / EEPROM data will be loaded from
+			userspace using the firmware mechanism)
+- qca,check-eeprom-endianness: Allow checking the EEPROM endianness and
+				swapping of the EEPROM data if required
+- qca,disable-2ghz: Disables the 2.4GHz band, even if enabled in the EEPROM
+- qca,disable-5ghz: Disables the 5GHz band, even if enabled in the EEPROM
+- mac-address: See ethernet.txt in the parent directory
+- local-mac-address: See ethernet.txt in the parent directory
+
+In this example, the node is defined as child node of the PCI controller.
+
+pci {
+	pcie@0 {
+		reg = <0 0 0 0 0>;
+		#interrupt-cells = <1>;
+		#size-cells = <2>;
+		#address-cells = <3>;
+		device_type = "pci";
+
+		ath9k@0,0 {
+			compatible = "qca,ath9k";
+			reg = <0 0 0 0 0>;
+			qca,disable-5ghz;
