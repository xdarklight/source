+* Qualcomm Atheros ath9k wireless devices
+
+This node provides properties for configuring the ath9k wireless device. The
+node is expected to be specified as a child node of the PCI controller to
+which the wireless chip is connected.
+
+Required properties:
+- compatible: Should be "qca,ath9k"
+
+Optional properties:
+- reg: Address and length of the register set for the device.
+- qca,clk-25mhz: Defines that a 25MHz clock is used
+- qca,no-eeprom: Indicates that there is no physical EEPROM connected to the
+			ath9k wireless chip (in this case the calibration /
+			EEPROM data will be loaded from userspace using the
+			kernel firmware loader).
+- qca,check-eeprom-endianness: Enable this option if the two magic bytes (at
+				the beginning of the EEPROM data) are known
+				to indicate the correct endianness (enabling
+				this can break EEPROM parsing when the magic
+				bytes are "swapped" but the EEPROM data
+				itself is not swapped). When enabled, this
+				will automatically swap the EEPROM data if
+				required.
+- qca,disable-2ghz: Overrides the settings from the EEPROM and disables the
+			2.4GHz band. Setting this property is only needed
+			when the RF circuit does not support the 2.4GHz band
+			while it is enabled nevertheless in the EEPROM.
+- qca,disable-5ghz: Overrides the settings from the EEPROM and disables the
+			5GHz band. Setting this property is only needed when
+			the RF circuit does not support the 5GHz band while
+			it is enabled nevertheless in the EEPROM.
+- mac-address: See ethernet.txt in the parent directory
+- local-mac-address: See ethernet.txt in the parent directory
+
+In this example, the node is defined as child node of the PCI controller.
